# Credit_Scoring

Local Finance Company wants to give loan to villagers to buy a two-wheller vehicle, model is not good as the data is not as good as we could have in a city. And that is the challenge.

Also you need to learn definitions on your own, clean it, and form train, validation and test data-sets. 
And most importantly there is no column as target, you need to find from the transaction-bounce_data who repayed the loan and who did not.

It might happen that there is no correlation between the data and the target.
Well! ALL THE BEST
